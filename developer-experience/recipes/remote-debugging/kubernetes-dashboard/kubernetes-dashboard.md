# Remote Debugging using the Kubernetes Dashboard

This document covers the Kubernetes Dashboard which is a useful tool for remote debugging for Kubernetes Clusters. It allows the management of applications running in the cluster, debug them and manage the cluster all through this dashboard.

## Overview and Background

Developer experience focuses on how easy or difficult it is for a developer to perform essential tasks needed to implement a change including build, test, start, and debug.

There are times when not all solutions can be run locally. This limitation could be due to a cloud service which does not offer a robust or efficient way to locally debug the environment. In these cases, it is necessary to deploy use other tools that enabling this remote debugging. One such example is the Kubernetes dashboard.
