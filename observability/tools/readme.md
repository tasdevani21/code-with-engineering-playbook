# Tools

There are a number of modern tools to make systems observable. While identifying and/or creating tools that work for your system, here are a few things to consider to help guide the choices.

- Must be simple to integrate and easy to use.
- It must be possible to aggregate and visualize data.
- Tools must provide real-time data.
- Must be able to guide users to the problem area with suitable, adequate end-to-end context.

## Choices

- [Loki](./loki.md)
- [OpenTelemetry](./OpenTelemetry.md)
- [Kubernetes Dashboard](./Kubernetes-Dashboard.md)
